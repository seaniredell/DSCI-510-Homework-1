Homework 1

Code Specifications that must be met to be able to run the scrips dealing with Tikka Similarity and Etllib 

Specifications:
- Rename any columns that have "date" in the name
- Pynev must be installed and python should be updated to 2.7.18 (Etllib will not run on more modern versions)
- csvkit must be installed
- homebrew must be installed
- libmagic should be installed using homebrew
- ETLLib should be installed
- hirelite must be installed (IMPORTANT! must be installed on both python 2.7.18 and 3.1 (or whatever python 3.X you have installed)
- iso8601 must be installed

Data Extraction Considerations:
- During data extraction with requests and BeautifulSoup from World Population Review (MIME Type Message/HTTP), issues arose due to webpage structure changes. For example, a newly added table initially caused the original code to fail. The script was revised and tested to ensure functionality at the time of submission (March 14). However, if the webpage layout changes in the future, further modifications to the scraping script may be required.
